# OnlineRunBook
An Online Runbook For Moving Sessions Online

## We Will be using Zoom
  * Do we also use eventbrite or use Zoom registration?
  * Mentors will need to go through co-host training so they have the knowledge and ability to mute/remove disruptive participants
  
## Items to discuss
  * We cannot have 1:1 breakout rooms for 2 reasons:
    * Child safety. Kids should not go alone into breakout rooms with a mentor.
    * Creation of breakout rooms appears to be "host-only." Works great with 1 teacher and a classroom, not where the entire "school" is on one zoom meeting.
  * The idea is to treat each breakout room like an "Interest Table" - we have as many tables as mentors, each mentor has a topic they'll share.
    * Interest tables were normally 6-8 kids and a mentor.
    * It allows some individualized help.
  * Private chat - mentors can engage in private chat with a student only if a parent comes on camera and attests they're there to supervise.
    * Should another parent or mentor have to be a witness to ensure rules are being followed?
    * WE MUST ERR ON THE SIDE OF SAFETY FOR THE KIDS - convenience is not a reason to break rule.
    
## Code Collaboration Tools
  * Scratch - Students can save and share their project with a mentor. A mentor can look at the code and suggest edits.
  * Glitch (JavaScript) - Students can make a mentor a collaborator on their project. Mentors can come in, read code, make edits, make //comments
  * Repl.it (Multiple Languages) - Better for console apps, Python, Java - has collaborator mode
  
## New mentors
  * Can only be TA's (helping out under an experienced mentor)
  * Must get 3 sessions as TA under their belt to lead a breakout room
  * Must be supervised by an experienced mentor during their first two breakout room lead sessions
  
## Because it's harder to supervise new mentors, what vetting do we do?
  * Does an existing mentor need to interview them?
